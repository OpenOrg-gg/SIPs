# Simple Summary

<p>The goal of this SIP is to define a V3 tokenomics/reward model and to test pilot that system on Base before a larger role out.</p>

# Abstract

<p>This SIP proposes a V3 system in which there is one test pool on Base</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong><u>A Spartan Council Pool:</u></strong> Accepts ETH as collateral.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It would provide rewards as follows:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>60% of all rewards go to SNX Stakers.</li><li>20% of all rewards go to LPs.</li><li>20% of rewards go to integrators.</li></ul><p><br></p>
# Specification


### Overview

<p>This reward pool system provides us a method by which to onboard ETH collateral without overly diluting the value of SNX, or rewarding the value of idle SNX too much.</p>

### Rationale

<p>In order to onboard ETH as collateral, we'll need to be able to reward LPs.</p><p><br></p><p>The current debate has been between how much of the fees should go to SNX stakers versus to LPs. Which comes down to the question:</p><p><br></p><p class="ql-indent-1">"<em>Do we need to pay users to borrow, or is borrowing enough of a value add?"</em></p><p><br></p><p>The challenge becomes if SNX stakers are idle stakers without debt we are overpaying for minimal protocol gain.</p><p><br></p><p>This model lets us scale ETH LP while still capturing strong fees for ETH stakers and fairly rewarding partners.</p>

### Test Cases

<p>TBD</p>


### Configurable Values (Via SCCP)

<p>Eth collateral rate for each pool TBD</p>
